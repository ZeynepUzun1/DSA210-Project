## **Overview**

Understanding personal shopping behavior can reveal significant insights about decision making patterns that influence spending habits. By analyzing my own purchases, I aim to identify the key factors that drive my choices as a consumer. This analysis will look at how time patterns, physiological cycles and outside influences such as discounts impact my purchases. By gaining these insights, I hope to develop more mindful and intentional spending habits that align with my financial and personal goals.

## **Project Goal**
By tracking when I shop, what I spend and potential influences including my menstrual cycle, I aim to develop insights into my consumer psychology and create strategies for making more intentional purchasing decisions. These questions will be answered based on my data:

### **Research Questions**

* How do temporal patterns influence my clothing purchasing behavior and expenditure?

* How does brand preference impact my clothing purchase decisions and spending patterns?

* What is the relationship between the presence of discounts and my clothing purchasing behavior?

* How does my menstrual cycle correlate with patterns in my clothing purchase decisions and spending?

* What is the relationship between proximity to my salary date and my clothing purchasing behavior?

* How do seasonal factors influence my clothing purchasing patterns and expenditures?

## **Dataset**
This study will focus exclusively on my own shopping data, collected from 2024 through May 2025.


### Primary Data Collection


The dataset will be built using three main sources: transaction records, order confirmations and menstrual cycle tracking data from the period tracker app Flo. Item characteristics such as original price, discount details, product and brand name will be gathered from transaction records and order confirmations from online shopping platforms. Only spending on clothing will be analyzed to examine how factors like day of the week, discounts and other influences affect my purchasing decisions.

### Data Structure

The dataset will include these variables:


* Purchase date: The exact date the purchase was made.
* Day of the week: Which day of the week the purchase was made.
* Item name: The name of the purchased clothing item.
* Brand name: The brand name of the purchased clothing item.
* Price: The price of the item.
* Discount amount: Any discount applied to the item (if applicable).
* Season: The season during which the purchase was made (Spring: March-May, Summer: June-August, Fall: September-November, Winter: December-February).
* Hormonal cycle: Whether I was on my period or not on the date of purchase (tracked through the Flo app).
* Proximity to salary date: Number of days before or after my most recent salary payment (negative values indicate days before salary date, positive values indicate days after salary date).
